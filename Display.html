        Importance <span>of trees in protecting</span> our environmental
        Trees are beautiful and useful gifts of nature. Trees are great friends of men. Trees are a part and parcel of earthly life. All life directly or indirectly owes its existence to them.
        Tress helps to check soil erosion. When the rain occur in the region of forest or where trees are in good amount, soil erosion happen in very less amount and causes rain. It also controls the temperature and pollution by absorbing heat and carbon dioxide and cooling surrounding, increases the soil fertility also. Trees provide us with lots of things like by giving us food and shelter to animals, birds and human and many more things. Trees are like miracles which are given from God to us as they do many beneficial things for earth. It manage the ecological balance by giving us oxygen and taking carbon dioxide. Human is misusing this gift they are damaging it.
        If we want to save our life than first we have to save the trees otherwise nothing will be left on this earth. Earth is body and trees are the soul of it.
